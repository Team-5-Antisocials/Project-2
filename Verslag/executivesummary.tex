\section*{Executive summary}

The malicious Doodle Jump 2 application seems to be relatively harmless.
From the VirusTotal scan it seemed like this application would be riddled with AdWare, but after having performed a behavior analysis, it became clear that this wasnâ€™t really the case.
What did happen during this analysis is that a pop-up was displayed with a message in Arabic.
Other than this all the collectibles and levels were unlocked.
The network and process analysis did not reveal anything that seemed malicious.
In fact, it showed how similar the application worked with the legitimate application.
The code analyses of both applications did seem to show differences, but not ones which were significant.
All of this would lead an outside observer to believe that the malicious application is not really all that malicious, but rather the result of a hobbyist who likes to tinker with popular apps in his or her free time.
Anybody who would like a fully completed version of an application could then go to his website and download the APK file.
It is safe to say after all these findings that there are not only malicious hackers, but also benevolent ones.
