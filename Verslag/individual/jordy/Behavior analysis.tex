\subsection{Behavior analysis}
To get a better understanding of the malicious application a behavior analysis was performed.
The process and results of the behavior analysis are described in this chapter.

When a user installed the application it showed up in the overall app screen.
The application was installed already.
When the app was opened it showed an installation screen with all the permissions that were described in chapter 4.1.2.1 along with the button install.
When the install button was clicked on it showed installing for a couple of seconds and then changed to the screen “App not installed” along with a button "done".
 
If the user finished the previous steps then FireFox would disappear from the overall app screen.
There would be no clue of the application being installed on the phone.
After going back to the home screen and looking at the notification bar it would show as a pop-up.
This pop-up showed the name “FireFox” and underneath it showed “Browser”.
If the pop-up was clicked on, it would send the user back to the home screen and nothing would happen.

If a user went to their Settings app and went to the Apps section it showed that the FireFox application was in fact still installed and was running.
The only options a user had on this page was to force stop and to uninstall the application.
The application that was imitating Firefox was not able to be used as a web browser.
