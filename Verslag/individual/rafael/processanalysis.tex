\subsection{Process analysis}

To get a better understanding of how the application performs and interacts with the phone a process analysis was done.
The process analysis results were described in this chapter.

For the process analysis the logs the application made during execution were captured.
The logs displayed the results from telegram, a lot of errors and any popups the application made.
The logs reconfirmed any previous thoughts about the application contacting telegram.
The application seemed to create a lot of errors, most of the errors were \texttt{SocketTimeoutException}s, they indicated that the read operation timed out.
Sadly, this information was not very useful.

The memory was also profiled, which made it quite apparent that a lot of strings were being allocated.
Sadly, android studio did not make a heap dump available, thus the contents of the strings could not be read.
The application used quite a lot of memory, with an \texttt{81 MB} peak usage.
